# Week 2

## Day 1:
- Completed the travel packing list project I was working on! I have uploaded the source code.
  
## Day 2:
- Learned about children props and how they can be very useful for passing jsx as a prop, learned how to make reusable components using props and children props, getting deeper understanding of the workflow of real world apps day by day. [Here](https://r49sqy.csb.app/) is an accordion app I built following a tutorial.
