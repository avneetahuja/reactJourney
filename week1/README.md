# Week 1

This is the beginning to my react journey here is what I managed to complete in this week:

## Day 1:
- Worked on my first react app following a tutorial, used api calls, props, useEffect, useState and JSX, link to sandbox is here:
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/bitter-sound-tjrkw7?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js%3A30%2C36

  And the link to the app is here:
  https://tjrkw7.csb.app/

- Wrote a pure react app, included a clock that ticks, file can be found in pure react folder

## Day 2:
- Decided to learn/review some JS concepts that may be used in React including: Destructuring arrays/objects, template literals, Array ops like map, filter, sort, optional chaining, async methods, etc.
