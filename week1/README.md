# Week 1

This is the beginning to my react journey here is what I managed to complete in this week:

## Day 1:
- Worked on my first react app following a tutorial, used api calls, props, useEffect, useState and JSX, link to sandbox is here:
https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/bitter-sound-tjrkw7?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js%3A30%2C36

  And the link to the app is here:
  https://tjrkw7.csb.app/

- Wrote a pure react app, included a clock that ticks, file can be found in pure react folder

## Day 2:
- Decided to learn/review some JS concepts that may be used in React including: Destructuring arrays/objects, template literals, Array ops like map, filter, sort, optional chaining, async methods, etc.

## Day 3:
- Learned Components how to nest them and started learning JSX rules, made a profile card mini project at the following code sandbox:
  https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/profilecard-gfq7px?file=%2Fsrc%2Findex.js%3A59%2C9

  Link to app page:

## Day 4:
- Developed a static web page for a local company, proof of concept really, going to start to learn how to make it dynamic. Anyways, in this one, used lots of components, props, conditional rendering, played around with JSX and it did hurt my head a bit at the start with JS being within JSX and having some JSX inside it but getting used to it as I progress. The page's v1 can be found under the **stationaryApp** folder. Here is a preview of the page:
